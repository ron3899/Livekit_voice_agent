              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"

Generate a multiscale, chunked, multi-dimensional spatial image data structure
that can serialized to [OME-NGFF].

Each scale is a scientific Python [Xarray] [spatial-image] [Dataset], organized
into nodes of an Xarray [Datatree].

## Installation

```sh
pip install multiscale_spatial_image
```

## Usage

```python
import numpy as np
from spatial_image import to_spatial_image
from multiscale_spatial_image import to_multiscale
import zarr

# Image pixels
array = np.random.randint(0, 256, size=(128,128), dtype=np.uint8)

image = to_spatial_image(array)
print(image)
```

An [Xarray] [spatial-image] [DataArray]. Spatial metadata can also be passed
during construction.

While the decorator allows you to define your own methods to map over datasets
in the `DataTree` while ignoring those datasets not having dimensions, this
library also provides a few convenience methods. For example, the transpose
method we saw earlier can also be applied as follows:

```python
multiscale = multiscale.msi.transpose("y", "x", "c")
```

Other methods implemented this way are `reindex`, equivalent to the
`xr.DataArray`
[reindex](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/generated/xarray.DataArray.reindex.html)
method and `assign_coords`, equivalent to `xr.Dataset` `assign_coords` method.

Store as an Open Microscopy Environment-Next Generation File Format ([OME-NGFF])
/ [netCDF] [Zarr] store.

It is highly recommended to use `dimension_separator='/'` in the construction of
the Zarr stores.

```python
store = zarr.storage.DirectoryStore('multiscale.zarr', dimension_separator='/')
multiscale.to_zarr(store)
```

**Note**: The API is under development, and it may change until 1.0.0 is
released. We mean it :-).

## Development

Contributions are welcome and appreciated.

### Get the source code

```shell
git clone https://github.com/spatial-image/multiscale-spatial-image
cd multiscale-spatial-image
```

### Install dependencies

First install [pixi]. Then, install project dependencies:

```shell
pixi install -a
pixi run pre-commit-install
```

### Run the test suite

The unit tests:

```shell
pixi run -e test test
```

The notebooks tests:

```shell
pixi run test-notebooks
```

### Update test data

To add new or update testing data, such as a new baseline for this block:

```py
dataset_name = "cthead1"
image = input_images[dataset_name]
baseline_name = "2_4/XARRAY_COARSEN"
multiscale = to_multiscale(image, [2, 4], method=Methods.XARRAY_COARSEN)
verify_against_baseline(test_data_dir, dataset_name, baseline_name, multiscale)
```

Add a `store_new_image` call in your test block:

```py
dataset_name = "cthead1"
image = input_images[dataset_name]
baseline_name = "2_4/XARRAY_COARSEN"
multiscale = to_multiscale(image, [2, 4], method=Methods.XARRAY_COARSEN)

store_new_image(dataset_name, baseline_name, multiscale)

verify_against_baseline(dataset_name, baseline_name, multiscale)
```

Run the tests to generate the output. Remove the `store_new_image` call.

Then, create a tarball of the current testing data

```console
cd test/data
tar cvf ../data.tar *
gzip -9 ../data.tar
python3 -c 'import pooch; print(pooch.file_hash("../data.tar.gz"))'
```

Update the `test_data_sha256` variable in the _test/\_data.py_ file. Upload the
data to [web3.storage](https://web3.storage). And update the
`test_data_ipfs_cid`
[Content Identifier (CID)](https://proto.school/anatomy-of-a-cid/01) variable,
which is available in the web3.storage web page interface.

### Submit the patch
