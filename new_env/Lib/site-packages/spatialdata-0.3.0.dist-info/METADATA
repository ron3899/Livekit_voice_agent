SpatialData is a data framework that comprises a FAIR storage format and a collection of python libraries for performant access, alignment, and processing of uni- and multi-modal spatial omics datasets. This repository contains the core spatialdata library. See the links below to learn more about other packages in the SpatialData ecosystem.

- [spatialdata-io](https://github.com/scverse/spatialdata-io): load data from common spatial omics technologies into spatialdata.
- [spatialdata-plot](https://github.com/scverse/spatialdata-plot): Static plotting library for spatialdata.
- [napari-spatialdata](https://github.com/scverse/napari-spatialdata): napari plugin for interactive exploration and annotation of spatial data.

- **The library is currently under review.** We expect there to be changes as the community provides feedback. We have an announcement channel for communicating these changes, please see the contact section below.
- The SpatialData storage format is built on top of the [OME-NGFF](https://ngff.openmicroscopy.org/latest/) specification.

## Getting started

Please refer to the [documentation][link-docs]. In particular:

- [API documentation][link-api].
- [Design doc][link-design-doc].
- [Example notebooks][link-notebooks].

Another useful resource to get started is the source code of the [`spatialdata-io`](https://github.com/scverse/spatialdata-io) package, which shows example of how to read data from common technologies.

## Installation

Check out the docs for more complete [installation instructions](https://spatialdata.scverse.org/en/stable/installation.html). To get started with the "batteries included" installation, you can install via pip:

```bash
pip install "spatialdata[extra]"
```

or via conda:

```bash
mamba install -c conda-forge spatialdata napari-spatialdata spatialdata-io spatialdata-plot
```

## Limitations

- Code only manually tested for Windows machines. Currently the framework is being developed using Linux, macOS and Windows machines, but it is automatically tested only for Linux and macOS machines.
